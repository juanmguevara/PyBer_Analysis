# PyBer_Analysis
## Summary:
After finishing our analysis of our ride-share data we can see that there is an increase in the number of rides and drivers for urban areas, but because this is in a rural area we can see how the majority of average fare is on the lower side given that the traveling distance is relatively low. Furthermore, suburban areas have a fine medium between rural and urban cityâ€™s in terms of average fare cost and number of riders/drivers. The increase in cost correlates to the increase in distance needing to travel for suburban cities. Rural areas, have the highest average fare cost, but also have the lowest drivers/riders in demand.

The analysis taken from the Pyber Ride-Sharing Data (2019), can also be further evaluated in the histograms for the Ride Count Data, Ride Fare Data, and Driver Count Data. Providing the same conclusion with the additional mean, median, and mode details.
