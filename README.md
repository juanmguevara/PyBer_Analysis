# PyBer_Analysis
## Summary:
After finishing our analysis of our ride-share data we can see that there is an increase in the number of rides and drivers for urban areas, but because this is in a rural area we can see how the majority of average fare is on the lower side given that the traveling distance is relatively low. Furthermore, suburban areas have a fine medium between rural and urban cityâ€™s in terms of average fare cost and number of riders/drivers. The increase in cost correlates to the increase in distance needing to travel for suburban cities. Rural areas, have the highest average fare cost, but also have the lowest drivers/riders in demand.

The analysis taken from the Pyber Ride-Sharing Data (2019), can also be further evaluated in the histograms for the Ride Count Data, Ride Fare Data, and Driver Count Data. Providing the same conclusion with the additional mean, median, and mode details.

The mean for the ride counts for urban trips is 24.62.
The median for the ride counts for urban trips is 24.0.
The mode for the ride counts for urban trips is ModeResult(mode=array([22]), count=array([7])).

The mean for the ride counts for surban trips is 17.36.
The median for the ride counts for surban trips is 17.0.
The mode for the ride counts for urban trips is ModeResult(mode=array([17]), count=array([7])).

The mean for the ride counts for surban trips is 6.94.
The median for the ride counts for surban trips is 6.0.
The mode for the ride counts for urban trips is ModeResult(mode=array([6]), count=array([5])).

We can see the bulk of the fares came from the urban cities. Suburban cities have a good medium of the total fares. Rural taking a smaller portion of the overall fare costs.

Results essentially mirroring the above we can see how the total amount of riders were located in urban areas.

As for the percentage of drivers, we can see there is a huge percentage of drivers in Urban cities compared to Suburban and Rural cities. This means that there is high demand for all of these drivers in Urban areas which corresponds to the number of riders contributed to these areas.

Above is the summary table for the Data set. Really highlighting how urban cities really have a high demand for drivers. Despite the low average ride fare the immense number of rides requested in urban areas really help bring a high total fare; compared to the suburban and rural areas.

The graph highlights the seasonal times which fares/number of drivers is increased. we can see for Urban cities there is an increase in the number of drivers from January to mid-February and after that it becomes volatile until April. Suburban cities trend line is relatively calm with an exception of a small spike mid-February. Rural cities maintain their demand across each month with an exception of April providing the highest fare overall.
